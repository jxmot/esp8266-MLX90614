# esp8266-MLX90614
A sketch that reads a MLX90614 non-contact temperature sensor. An HTML/JavaScript client is also present. The sketch sends the data to Thingspeak and the client retrieves it.

The quantity and appearance of the gauges is configurable. If you add more fields to the Thingspeak channel it's relatively easy to add a gauge.

## Status

**2017-12-31** : Works, needs a better README and some additional comments in the code.
